# A-Study-on-DTrace
This paper presents an in-depth study on the DTrace tool. For this, several programs were carried out in order to explore several of the features of this tool. These programs make it possible to make system call tracings and thus organize information about their instrumentation, which was then carefully studied in order to verify the correctness of the developed programs and thus verify a good learning of the tool in question. It should also be noted that all of this study was performed in a Solaris 11 environment and, for this reason, the instrumented data will only be related to this environment.
